# CustomerSegmentation
Objective: Investigate the impact of acquisition channels on customers learning outcomes on a learning platform and identify key geographic regions where this platform is discovered, particularly through social media like YouTube or Facebook. This project uses real-world customer data for market segmentation, involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of k-means and hierarchical clustering techniques.

Dataset Highlights:

Minutes_watched : learning time spent on the platform (after starting a course).
CLV : Customer Lifetime Value.
Channel Variable: Describes the platform discovery source, including Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Friend recommendations, and Others.
Region Variable: Locates customers based on geographical locations, categorizing them into 0 (USA and Canada), 1 (Europe), and 2 (The rest of the world).
Techniques Applied:

Data Preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Feature Engineering.
K-means Clustering.
Hierarchical Clustering.
